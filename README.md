# Android SDN Controller -- SoftOffload Client

The Android SDN controler is a client-side extension designed for SoftOffload to support intelligent traffic offloading. It cooperates with [SoftOffload Master](https://github.com/TKTL-SDN/SoftOffload-Master), helps the central controller of SoftOffload to collect user-based information, and responses to requests from the central controller.

## Usage

1. Build this application on your Android devices (4.0+), or install our [sample apk](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/eit-sdn/files/SDNController_sample.apk) file.

2. Switch on the "SDN CONTROLLING". This enables our application to react as a SoftOffload client, response requests sent from the controller.

3. You can also perform some extra work like "WiFi scanning" and "file downloading" with our application. Those functions are designed for our research project.

4. Some specific parameters can be changed in "settings".
